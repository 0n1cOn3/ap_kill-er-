## General Information

  Acces Point Killer was only for my personal help, i have not found a working tool that deauthenticate all access points(AP)
  out of network. After some researching i began to wrote this little script-tool. 
  The AP killer automatically changing your mac address at the setup, then it checks if you have enabled **wlan0mon** or not.
  You can enable it manually before you are starting the script. This tool is an linux CLI tool, which only works on **Linux**
  and not Termux or other phone platforms.
