# General Information

  Acces Point Killer was only for my personal help, i have not found a working tool that deauthenticate all access points(AP)
  out of network. After some researching i began to write this little script-tool. 
  The AP killer automatically changing your mac address at the setup, then it checks if you have enabled **mon**-interface or
  not. It will detect if you are already in monitor mode or not.
  You can enable it manually before you are starting the script. This tool is an linux CLI tool, which only works on **Linux**
  and not Termux or other phone platforms.

# Access Point Flooder
  This is a script that flood all channels in your range with access points.
  The script is more for trolling people, you can still use it if you can. 
  You can use own word for SSIDs.
  SSID = Name of WiFi.
  
  The script will read the file ```~/ap_killer/wordlist.txt``` so you can add manually, generate or skip it.
  
  *Manualy:*
  
  Script will prompt a gedit file, type any name upto 10 characters and save it with ctrl+s, close it with alt+f4.
  
  *Automatically:*
  
  User will enter count of words, then it generates words and using them.
  
  *Skipping:*
  
  If you have already a file inside there, then it will skip.
  
  
  **How To Use:**
  
  ```chmod +x fakeap.sh```
  
  **Run Script:**
  
  ```./fakeap.sh <interface>```
  
  **Example**
  
  ```./fakeap.sh wlan0mon```
