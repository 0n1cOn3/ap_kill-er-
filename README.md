## General Information

  Acces Point Killer was only for my personal help, i have not found a working tool that deauthenticate all access points(AP)
  out of network. After some researching i began to wrote this little script-tool. 
  The AP killer automatically changing your mac address at the setup, then it checks if you have enabled **wlan0mon** or not.
  You can enable it manually before you are starting the script. This tool is an linux CLI tool, which only works on **Linux**
  and not Termux or other phone platforms.

## Changelog

  **[BETA] v0.1:**
  * Added 2 methods to attack
  * Added MAC changer

## Disclaimer
  Use this tool for purposes only .:-) üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  If you do any illegal attacks, i am not responsible for your tasks.
  Use this tool correctly, and do not re-upload it on your github repository without permissions.

## Installation

  You can use any linux you want.
  
  ```git clone https://github.com/ViperZCrew/ap_killer.git```
  
  ```cd ap_killer && chmod +x *.sh```
  
  Using Tool at attack:
  

```bash setup.sh```


```main.sh``` is the main script but do not start it because then setup.sh enable the monitor mode and mac spoofer.
  Make sure you have killed all networking processes, and close firefox or any internet application.
